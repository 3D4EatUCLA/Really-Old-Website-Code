                        the club.

                        Attendance at general meetings is <strong><u>not</u></strong> required. If you cannot make it to meetings, but would
                        like to be in a project, you can report your progress via email.

                        Yes. We generally do a large workshop at the beginning of the academic year. We can also arrange training sessions
                        for CAD & 3D Printing on an ad hoc basis. If there is enough interests from new members, we can arrange larger group

                        Homeless youth are one of the most underserved populations. Since they are often underaged, they have
                        difficulty securing jobs, and do not have nearly as many resources available to them as homeless adults.
                        We chose to serve these youth since it is a great opportunity for us to effectively utilize our resources and
                        provide the youth with a future career opportunity.
